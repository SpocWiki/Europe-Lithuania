> The history of Lithuania dates back to settlements founded about 10,000 years ago, 
> but the first written record of the name for the country dates back to 1009 AD. 
> 
> Lithuanians, one of the Baltic peoples, later conquered neighboring lands 
> and established the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century 
> (and also a short-lived Kingdom of Lithuania). 
> The Grand Duchy was a successful and lasting warrior state. 
> It remained fiercely independent and was one of the last areas of Europe to adopt Christianity 
> (beginning in the 14th century). 
> A formidable power, it became the largest state in Europe in the 15th century 
> spread from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, 
> through the conquest of large groups of East Slavs who resided in Ruthenia.
>
> In 1385, the Grand Duchy formed a dynastic union with Poland through the Union of Krewo. 
> Later, the Union of Lublin (1569) created the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. 
> 
> During the Second Northern War, the Grand Duchy sought protection under the Swedish Empire 
> through the Union of Kėdainiai in 1655. 
> 
> However, it soon returned to being a part of the Polish–Lithuanian state, 
> which persisted until 1795 when the last of the Partitions of Poland 
> erased both independent Lithuania and Poland from the political map. 
> 
> After the dissolution, Lithuanians lived under the rule of the Russian Empire until the 20th century, 
> although there were several major rebellions, especially in 1830–1831 and 1863.
>
> On 16 February 1918, Lithuania was re-established as a democratic state. 
> It remained independent until the onset of World War II, 
> when it was occupied by the Soviet Union under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. 
> 
> Following a brief occupation by Nazi Germany after the Nazis waged war on the Soviet Union, 
> Lithuania was again absorbed into the Soviet Union for nearly 50 years. 
> 
> In 1990–1991, Lithuania restored its sovereignty 
> with the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania. 
> Lithuania joined the NATO alliance in 2004 and the European Union as part of its enlargement in 2004.
